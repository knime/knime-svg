	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Read images from a list of URLs and append
			them as a new column. The
			URL list is a column in the input table
			containing valid URLs (e.g.
			<tt>file:/tmp/image.png</tt>
			).
			You can use the "List Files" node to scan a directory
			containing
			*.png or *.svg files. The URLs may also point to *.zip files, in this
			case the zip is opened and the first found image of the selected
			types is parsed.
			Depending of the selected image type an
			appropriate
			column type is chosen.
		</intro>
		<option name="URL Column">
			Select the input column containing the URLs.
		</option>
		<option name="Replace input column">
			If selected the node will replaced the selected
			URL column with
			the image data.
		</option>
		<option name="Append new column">
			If selected the node will append a new column with
			the given
			name.
		</option>
        <option name="Type Selection (SVG, PNG)">
            Select which types are valid in the input. If a non-valid
            type is encountered it will handle the error according to the
            "Fail on invalid input" option.
        </option>
        <option name="Fail on invalid input">
			If selected, the node will fail during execution
			if any URL
			is invalid or points to an invalid image file. If
			unselected, the
			node will skip these invalid entries and insert a
			missing value
			instead. Note that if the parsing fails for all rows,
			the node will
			fail in either case.
